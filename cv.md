## Code examples
### Isograms
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)


* isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
* isIsogram "moose" = false
* isIsogram "aba" = false

### Solution
```
function isIsogram(str){
  return new Set(str.toLowerCase()).size === str.length  
}
```
